## Primary project objective
- Histograms are often cited as the most common visualization utilized by statisticans.  This exercise serves as a bit of a love story to histograms, and introduces a few easy enhancements to make them more illustrative of the underlying data.

## Primary languages
- R

## Highlighted visualizations
- (below) A scatterplot of the data, selected for its peculiarity.
